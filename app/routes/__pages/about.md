About moodboardr
================

I created moodboardr as an app for messing around with [Remix](https://remix.run/). In fact, I'm writing this Markdown file right now mostly for testing this feature of Remix. I also wrote a small amount of [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) code to load things from an SQL database.

Since you made it to this page, maybe you are interested in the code of this app? It's your lucky day, coincidentially the whole code is available on [GitHub at `bxt/moodboardr`](https://github.com/bxt/moodboardr), go check it out!
